# Resto
„Resto” is a Spanish first person singular form of a verb „restar”, which can
be translated as „to remain”. There is also an obvious phonetic connection to
an English verb „to rest”.
The name is explaining two main purposes of the application: to count the
remaining time of your work and to take care of your regular rests.
